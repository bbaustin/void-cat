## What is js13kGames?

Every year from August 13 - September 13, the nice people at js13kGames organize a game jam event. Participants must make a game whose total size is 13kb or less. There's also a unique theme to make your game about every year. For 2025, the theme was "black cat."

## What is VOID Cat?

VOID Cat is a game/interactive story in which you help a black cat on its weight-loss journey. 

It has _extremely limited deck-building elements_, _grid-based strategy_ on a grid whose out-of-bounds logic actually works this year (probably), and a story that will _shake Js13k to its very core_. 

## Considerations
+ If you read all of the story, VOID Cat will take 10 or so minutes to play. 
+ You can't save the game, so you have to do it all in one go.
