+ Rotation looks crazy because it can go from 0 --> 270 (rather than 0 ---> -90). Try and fix that 

+ Change cards' text when rotated

+ Cat movement pixels are estimated and are a little off.
  + Figure out mathematically how to do this? Could be based on percentage..!

+ Turns, and transitioning from game to intermission when turns are done


+ Interactions (picking up items from grid)

+ Cards burning calories

+ Overall UI
