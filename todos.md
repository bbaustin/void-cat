MUST DO

+ Make energy actually stop you from doing stuff 

+ Implement script

+ Remove intermission stuff 


SHOULD DO

+ Beginning / ending

+ More sounds

+ Rotation looks crazy because it can go from 0 --> 270 (rather than 0 ---> -90). Try and fix that 

+ Animating when you can't roll or rotate in a certain direction



WONT DO
+ Popup explanations 

+ If you need to remove kbs, grab next button once... 

+ Card buying / deleting 
  + Most likely pare down the intermission to not have upgrades

+ Cat movement pixels are estimated and are a little off.
  + Figure out mathematically how to do this? Could be based on percentage..!

+ Animating the roll
