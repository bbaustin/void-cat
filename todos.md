MUST DO


+ Implement script
  + How does this fit into the game? Think about it

+ Intermission stuff
  + Remove, pretty much. But also:
    + Beginning / ending
    + This can use intermission page 
    + 5 days left...
    + 4 days left... 

+ Assemble fun deck
  + Add cards per level 

+ Make turns and energy animate 


SHOULD DO

+ More sounds DONEISH? Anything missing?

+ Animating when you can't roll or rotate in a certain direction

+ If you can't play a card, don't discard it 
  + Could be cheat-fixed by removing cards that ONLY apply position. It's a good idea.

WONT DO
+ Popup explanations 

+ If you need to remove kbs, grab next button once... 

+ Card buying / deleting 
  + Most likely pare down the intermission to not have upgrades

+ Cat movement pixels are estimated and are a little off.
  + Figure out mathematically how to do this? Could be based on percentage..!

+ Animating the roll
