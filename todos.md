+ Rotation looks crazy because it can go from 0 --> 270 (rather than 0 ---> -90). Try and fix that 

+ Change cards' text when rotated

+ Cat movement pixels are estimated and are a little off.
  + Figure out mathematically how to do this? Could be based on percentage..!

+ Turns, and transitioning from game to intermission when turns are done


+ Interactions (picking up items from grid)

+ Cards burning calories

+ Overall UI 

+ Animating the roll

+ Animating when you can't roll or rotate in a certain direction

+ Little popups notifications when you've gained something 

+ Longcat design

+ Curl design
